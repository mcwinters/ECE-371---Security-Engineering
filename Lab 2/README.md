Lab 2 - Image Encryption / Decryption in Python

des.py: File to compute Data Encryption Standard (DES). We wrote the compute_s_box() function which returned 4 bit output from S-Box from 6 bit input. We also wrote the substitute() function which takes in input string of 48 bits, return SBOX results

rsa.py: File to compute Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) public-key cryptosystem. We wrote all functions to recreate RSA, utilizing Euclidean math.
